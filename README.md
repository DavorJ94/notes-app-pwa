# Google Keep Clone

Page created mainly for Javascript practice, no additional frameworks.

You can preview page at https://davorj94.github.io/google-keep-notes-clone/.

The page looks like the design from Scrimba, but additional functionality is added and no code is used from there.

Each note is saved to local storage and can be accessed during following sessions after its creation.

Color picker is added for additional UX.

Also, option to delete each note, as well as edit whichever note user wishes is made possible (achieving the improved UX).

Page is responsive, it is adjusted for mobile phones, as well as desktops.

If you have any advice how to improve this project, feel free to contact me.
